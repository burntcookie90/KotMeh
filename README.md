#KotMeh

This application was written as a test application for using [Kotlin](kotlinlang.org) and [Anko](https://github.com/JetBrains/anko) in an MVP architecture alongside varous Java libraries. 
The application uses [meh.com](meh.com)'s api for it's data source.

I've tried to utilize various Kotlin features that I found to be pretty useful. 
You'll see examples of delegated properties, anko UI design, expression body syntax, as well as Java interoperations.

To use this in Android Studio, you're going to need to install the Kotlin [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6954?pr=idea) as well as the Kotlin Extensions [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7717?pr=idea).
