# KotMeh

This application was written as a test application for using [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org) and [Anko](https://github.com/JetBrains/anko) in an MVP architecture alongside varous Java libraries. 
The application uses [meh.com](http://meh.com)'s api for it's data source.

I've tried to utilize various Kotlin features that I found to be pretty useful. 
You'll see examples of delegated properties, anko UI design, expression body syntax, as well as Java interoperations.

## Building

To use this in Android Studio, you're going to need to install the Kotlin [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6954?pr=idea) as well as the Kotlin Extensions [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7717?pr=idea).

You'll also need to copy `meh.properties.example` into `meh.properties` and place your api key in the file.
